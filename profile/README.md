## [IntelComp H2020 project](https://intelcomp.eu/)

***A Competitive Intelligence Cloud/High Performance Computing Platform for Artificial Intelligence-based Science, Technology and Innovation Policy Making***

Large Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) datasets are processed on High Performance Computing (HPC) environment part of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) imitative. Public administration at all geographical and organizational levels, STI stakeholders and civil society produce a great amount of dynamic, multilingual and heterogeneous data (i.e. national STI strategies, plans and work programmes, calls, projects, reports, scientific publications, patents, dissemination articles, etc.), so understanding and analyzing this data is crucial for evidence-based policy making.

The objective of IntelComp is to deliver a platform that provides tools for assisting the whole spectrum of STI policy, i.e., agenda setting, modeling design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

### Open Source Platform

The IntelComp platform allows access to its source code to users or developers.

The repositories hosting the IntelComp Applications and AI toolboxes in GitHub are open source to facilitate their use and expansion beyond the scope of the project. Users can choose the applications and customize and integrate them in their own processes.
